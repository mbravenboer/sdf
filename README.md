## SGLR - Scannerless Generalized LR parser

## SDF - Syntax Definition Formalism

## Background

The C implementations of SDF and SGLR and was originally developed at the CWI in the
Netherlands. The original repositories can be found here:

    - https://github.com/cwi-swat/meta-environment
    - https://github.com/cwi-swat/rscript-meta/

The main changes so far are a simplified build system (removing autotools) and updates for
modern C compilers.

The SGLR C implementation was abandoned because the main developers and users moved to
Java-based systems, which you may prefer to explore:

    - Rascal - https://github.com/usethesource/rascal
    - Spoofax - https://spoofax.dev

## Authors

The current packaging and build is maintained by Martin Bravenboer. Please note that
essentially none of the C code was written by me.
