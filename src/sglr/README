SGLR Scannerless Generalized LR parser

This package contains among other tools a scannerless generalized LR parser.
The parser is instantiated by giving it a parsetable. The parsetables for SGLR are typically generated by the SDF2 parser generator, which is available
at http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv.

The output of a successful parse is a parse tree in one of the following
formats: AsFix1, AsFix2 or AsFix2me. Libraries and descriptions for these three
formats are available from http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv in the
PT support package.
